## Open Source for Public Good

# Building Digital Public Infrastructure for the World

In today's complex state of geopolitics marked by de-globalization and weaponized economics, software security is a key aspect of national security and national independence, especially in the digital public infrastructure that powers nations. Free and open source software 
that can be freely developed, deployed and used without restrictions from world powers is the path to software freedom. 

The Lanka Software Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping Sri Lankan software engineers create such software for the world.
